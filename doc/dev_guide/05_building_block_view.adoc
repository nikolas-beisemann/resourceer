.Resourceer Building Blocks
|===
| Building Block | Description

| index | Main entry point into the Electron application. Creates the main and renderer processes, and loads the frontend application.
| native | In charge of the native aspects of the application, such as managing browser instances, and user menu.
| frontend | The main resource management application.
| lang | Json files with localization.
|===

Communication between frontend and backend occurs by the interprocess communication API provided by Electron. The native application uses https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main[ipcMain], the frontend https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer[ipcRenderer].

.IPC Interface

| Method | Direction | Description

| `load-request` | `native -> frontend` | Emitted when the user has requested to import Json data into the database. Contains the Json data as string.
| `save-request` | `native -> frontend` | Emitted when the user has requested to save Json data from the database.
| `save-reply` | `frontend -> native` | Emitted as a response to `save-request`. Contains the Json data as string.
| `dirty-request` | `frontend -> native` | Emitted when the database is initially changed, and needs to be saved to prevent data loss.
| `clean-request` | `native -> frontend` | Emitted when data was saved, or confirmed to be discarded. Leads to a new `dirty-request` on next change.
| `title-request` | `native -> frontend` | Emitted when the window title should be updated. Contains the name of the requested title as string.
